              I'm Ashish Kumar Sahu, a B.Tech student in Computer Science
              and Engineering at IIIT Bhubaneswar, graduating in 2027.
              Currently, I'm deeply focused on refining my full-stack
              development skills while solving real-world problems through
              technology. I enjoy exploring complex tasks, understanding their
              core requirements, and applying my technical knowledge to develop
              efficient, meaningful solutions. With a growth mindset, I'm
              consistently pushing my boundariesâ€”learning, experimenting, and
              evolving as a developer every day. I would love to share the projects
              I've worked on, showcasing my skills and dedication to creating
              impactful web experiences.
